# Regression Insights – Student Performance

## Problem Statement
Predict student performance index based on academic and lifestyle features.

---

## Models Implemented

### Linear Regression
- Assumes linear relationship between features and target
- Feature scaling applied
- Performs well as a baseline model

### Polynomial Regression
- Captures non-linear relationships
- Improved fit compared to linear regression
- Higher risk of overfitting with increased degree

---

## Model Comparison Summary

| Model | MAE | R2 Score | Strength | Limitation |
|-----|-----|----------|----------|------------|
| Linear Regression | Low | High | Simple, interpretable | Cannot model non-linearity |
| Polynomial Regression | Lower | Higher | Captures complexity | Overfitting risk |

---

## Key Learnings
- Feature scaling is critical for regression models
- Non-linear patterns exist in student performance data
- Model complexity should be balanced against generalization

---

## Conclusion
Linear Regression provides a strong baseline, while Polynomial Regression improves performance by modeling non-linear relationships.
